### 7.2 Implementation Details

**Class: MovementController**
```typescript
class MovementController {
  - scene: Scene
  - camera: ArcRotateCamera
  - moveSpeed: number
  - keysPressed: Map<string, boolean>
  - isEnabled: boolean
  
  + updateMovement(): void
  + setEnabled(enabled: boolean): void
  + setMoveSpeed(speed: number): void
  + dispose(): void
}
```

**Key Algorithms**:
1. Camera-relative movement vector calculation
2. XZ plane projection for horizontal movement
3. Frame-rate independent movement scaling
4. Input filtering for text fields

### 7.3 Data Flow
1. User presses movement key
2. KeyboardEvent captured by MovementController
3. Movement vector calculated based on camera orientation
4. Position updated in render loop
5. Camera and target positions synchronized
