# Next Steps for VibeCAD

## Current State Summary
**Completed Today:**
- ✅ Real-time Firestore updates for AI generations
- ✅ Generation history sidebar with status tracking
- ✅ Save/Load scene functionality
- ✅ Firestore security rules and indexes deployment
- ✅ Cloud Function integration with proper error handling

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Improve Error Handling & User Feedback
**Why:** Better user experience and clearer error messages
- Add toast notifications instead of alerts
- Implement retry functionality for failed generations
- Add timeout handling for long-running operations
- Show more detailed error messages in UI

### 2. Optimize Firestore Queries
**Why:** Indexes are now built, can add proper sorting
- Re-enable orderBy for generation history
- Re-enable orderBy for saved scenes
- Add pagination for large lists
- Implement search/filter capabilities

### 3. Begin Gemini Integration Planning
**Why:** Core goal is to generate actual 3D models
- Research Gemini API capabilities for 3D generation
- Design prompt structure for .glb generation
- Plan Cloud Function modifications
- Test with simple 3D model generation

### 4. Implement Model Gallery View
**Why:** Showcase generated models and enable sharing
- Create public gallery of generated models
- Add thumbnail generation for preview
- Implement sharing functionality
- Add like/favorite features

### 5. Set Up Firebase Hosting
**Why:** Deploy the application for public access
- Configure Firebase Hosting
- Set up production environment variables
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading screens and fallbacks

## Technical Debt to Address
1. **TypeScript Warnings**: Fix unused variable warnings
2. **Code Organization**: Consider splitting App.tsx into smaller components
3. **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for heavy components
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for critical functions

## Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **3D File Storage**: Design strategy for storing .glb files in Cloud Storage
2. **Caching**: Implement caching for repeated AI prompts
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add per-user quotas for AI generation
4. **Monitoring**: Set up performance monitoring and alerts

## Commands for Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

## Next Session Goals
1. Fix TypeScript warnings and re-enable proper sorting
2. Start Gemini API integration research
3. Implement better error handling with toast notifications
4. Begin work on model gallery view

Remember: The describeScene function is ready for Gemini integration!
