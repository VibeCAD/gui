# üèóÔ∏è Space Optimization Feature Guide

## Overview

The space optimization system helps you answer questions like "How many desks can I fit in this room?" and generates optimized furniture layouts. It includes professional-grade spatial analysis with accessibility compliance, safety checks, and ergonomic recommendations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Draw a Custom Room
1. Type "draw room panel" in the AI Assistant
2. Use the custom room drawing tool to create your floor plan
3. Save the room when finished

### Step 2: Access Space Optimization
1. Look for the "üèóÔ∏è Space Optimization" panel in the AI sidebar
2. You should see "‚úÖ Room available" if your room was created successfully

### Step 3: Analyze Space
1. Select a furniture type (Desk, Chair, Table, etc.)
2. Choose an optimization strategy:
   - **Maximize Capacity**: Fit as many objects as possible
   - **Comfort & Accessibility**: Prioritize ADA compliance and comfort
   - **Ergonomic Layout**: Optimize for workflow efficiency
   - **Aesthetic Balance**: Focus on visual appeal
3. Click "üîç Analyze Space"
4. **Objects are automatically placed in the scene** at optimal positions!

### Step 4: Manage Placed Objects
- Objects are automatically placed with IDs like "optimized-desk-1", "optimized-chair-2", etc.
- Use "üóëÔ∏è Clear Optimized Objects" to remove all placed objects
- The button shows the count of optimized objects currently in the scene

## üéØ Key Features

```

### Analyze Selected Objects
```
1. Select one or more furniture objects in the scene
2. Click "Analyze Selected" 
3. System analyzes how many similar objects can fit
4. Shows dimensions and space requirements
```

### Generate Complete Layouts
```
1. Select furniture type and strategy
2. Click "Generate Layouts"
3. Review multiple layout options with scores
4. Click "Apply Layout" to place furniture in scene
```

### Visualization Controls
```
1. Toggle "Show Visualization" checkbox
2. Select visualization mode:
   - Default: General placement zones
   - Accessibility: ADA compliance focus
   - Efficiency: Space utilization focus
   - Safety: Emergency access focus
3. Use layer controls to toggle zones, constraints, paths
```

## üîç Understanding Results

### Analysis Metrics
- **Max Objects**: Maximum number of items that can fit
- **Space Efficiency**: Percentage of room area utilized
- **Room Area**: Total and usable floor area

### Room Analysis
- **Total Area**: Complete floor space
- **Usable Area**: Space available after wall buffers
- **Density**: Objects per square meter

### Validation Scores
- **ADA Compliant**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå Accessibility requirements met
- **Fire Safety**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå Emergency egress paths clear
- **Functional Zones**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå Proper workflow areas

### Layout Scores (0-100)
- **Overall Score**: Combined quality metric
- **Accessibility**: ADA compliance level
- **Ergonomics**: Workflow efficiency
- **Safety**: Emergency access quality

## üé® Natural Language Queries

You can also use the AI Assistant with natural language:

### Example Queries
```
"How many desks can I fit in this room?"
"Analyze space for chairs"
"What's the best layout for this office?"
"How should I arrange this space for comfort?"
"Can I fit 6 chairs in here?"
"Optimize this room for accessibility"
```

### Query Examples by Strategy
```
Maximize: "How many tables can I fit?"
Comfort: "Arrange chairs for comfort"
Ergonomic: "Best desk layout for productivity"
Aesthetic: "Beautiful office arrangement"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No custom rooms found"**
- Solution: Create a room using "draw room panel" first

**"Could not determine furniture type"**
- Solution: Be specific in queries - use "desk" not "furniture"

**Low space efficiency**
- Try different optimization strategies
- Consider smaller furniture
- Check for accessibility conflicts

**Visualization not showing**
- Toggle "Show Visualization" checkbox
- Try different visualization modes
- Clear and regenerate if needed

### Performance Tips
- Use smaller rooms for faster analysis
- Limit furniture types for quicker results
- Clear visualizations when not needed

## üéâ Pro Tips

1. **Objects are placed automatically** - no need to manually position them!
2. **Clear before re-analyzing** - use "Clear Optimized Objects" to avoid duplicates
3. **Use "Analyze Selected"** to work with existing furniture
4. **Toggle visualization modes** to understand different aspects
5. **Check alternative options** for creative solutions
6. **Apply layouts gradually** - try one, then modify
7. **Use natural language** for quick analysis
8. **Combine strategies** - analyze with different approaches
9. **Watch the object counter** - see how many objects are placed in real-time
